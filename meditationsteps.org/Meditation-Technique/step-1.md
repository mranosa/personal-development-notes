- Why: Remove limitations by connecting with infinity.
- How:
    - Close your eyes
	- Imagine you are in a vast beautiful place that gives you a pleasant calm feeling. You are sitting completely alone, there is no one else around.
	- After you are fully engulfed in your imagination, focus your attention on your breathing
	- Mentally recite the mantra "BABA NAM KEVALAM". When you feel that you are focused, try to understand the meaning of the mantra which is "Joy is all there is".
- When: 
	- Twice a day, best time that works for you. Start with 5 mins. A good time for meditation is 15â€“20 minutes, but regularity is more important than intensity.
